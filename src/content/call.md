We invite the submission of research papers and position papers on the topic of programmatic representations for agent learning. This workshop aims to explore the use of program-like structures to represent policies, reward functions, tasks, and environment models.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* **Programs as Policies:** Representing decision-making logic through programmatic policies in Python or domain-specific languages.
* **Programs as Reward Functions:** Synthesizing reward function codes for agent learning.
* **Programmatically Generating Tasks:** Producing codes that describe diverse task variants.
* **Programs as Environment Models:** Inferring executable codes to simulate environment dynamics.

**Submission Types:**

* **Full Papers:** Up to 8 pages in ICML format, with potentially large-scale experiments.
* **Short Papers:** 2-4 pages in ICML format, with proof-of-concept demonstrations (demos, code, blog posts).

**Important Dates:**

* Submission Deadline: May 24, 2025, AoE
* Author Notification: June 7, 2025, AoE
* Camera Ready Deadline: July 7, 2025, AoE
* Workshop Date: July 18/19, 2025

Accepted papers will be presented during poster sessions, with exceptional submissions selected for spotlight oral presentations.

All accepted papers will be made publicly available as non-archival reports, allowing for future submissions to archival conferences or journals.
