Existing methods may struggle with adapting to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by augmentation with learned programmatic atomic facts (structured textual statements) and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to extract task-critical \\"atomic facts\\" from its interaction trajectories. These facts, serving as a form of programmatic representation, dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation (akin to using programs as environment models), and state-value estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided by these accumulated programmatic facts and interaction history. This approach allows the agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online.

We provide a theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy.

However, there is an urgent need for novel benchmarks that can effectively measure this capability and translate it into real-world impact. Current code benchmarks, which often rely on binary pass/fail outcomes, offer a limited evaluation framework that falls short of capturing the full potential of these emerging capabilities.  To bridge this gap, we introduce FormulaCode, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating agentic superoptimization on large codebases, with a focus on real-world performance optimization.  Constructed from a dataset of 451 real-world performance bottlenecks automatically mined from Github, FormulaCode enables comprehensive testing of an agent's ability to triage, diagnose, and resolve inefficiencies in realistic software environments. FormulaCode proves to be a challenging benchmark for frontier LLMs and agentic frameworks, with unrestricted repository exploration emerging as a principal component for finding performance inefficiencies. By introducing FormulaCode, our goal is to drive the development of next‑generation optimization algorithms that meet the rigorous demands of real‑world software projects."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/f461aa49fdd04055284c7579d2297c6eaaf07973.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track."},"supplementary_material":{"value":"/attachment/d4720e6046648ae69b42dee3570921ed14932593.pdf"},"Anonymization":{"value":"This submission has been anonymized for double-blind review via the removal of identifying information such as names, affiliations, and identifying URLs."},"Presenter":{"value":"~James_Hou1"},"venue":{"value":"ICML 2025 Workshop PRAL"},"venueid":{"value":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL"},"_bibtex":{"value":"@inproceedings{\\nanonymous2025formulacode,\\ntitle={FormulaCode: Evaluating Agentic Superoptimization on Large Codebases},\\nauthor={Anonymous},\\nbooktitle={ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning},\\nyear={2025},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=CMdtl83aZF}\\n}"},"paperhash":{"value":"sehgal|formulacode_evaluating_agentic_superoptimization_on_large_codebases","readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission30/Authors"]}},"number":30,"invitations":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Post_Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Edit"],"domain":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","tcdate":1748686213184,"cdate":1748686213184,"tmdate":1749884844944,"mdate":1749884844944,"pdate":1749884844904,"version":2,"details":{"writable":true,"replyCount":3,"presentation":[{"name":"title","order":1,"type":"string"},{"name":"keywords","order":4,"type":"string[]"},{"name":"TLDR","order":5,"type":"string","fieldName":"TL;DR"},{"name":"track","order":6,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)","description":null},{"name":"abstract","order":6,"type":"string","input":"textarea","markdown":true},{"name":"pdf","order":7,"type":"file"},{"name":"Format","order":8,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track.","description":null},{"name":"supplementary_material","order":9,"type":"file"},{"name":"De-Anonymization","order":10,"type":"string","input":"radio"},{"name":"Presenter","order":11,"type":"group"},{"name":"authors"},{"name":"authorids"},{"name":"venue","hidden":true},{"name":"venueid","hidden":true},{"name":"_bibtex","type":"string","input":"textarea"},{"name":"Anonymization"}]}},{"id":"c3PxSjfUYZ","forum":"c3PxSjfUYZ","license":"CC BY 4.0","signatures":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission27/Authors"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission27/Reviewers","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission27/Authors"],"writers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission27/Authors"],"content":{"title":{"value":"PDL: Declarative Representation of Agentic Prompting Patterns"},"authors":{"value":["Mandana Vaziri","Louis Mandel","Martin Hirzel","Anca Sailer","Yuji Watanabe","Hirokuni Kitahara"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission27/Authors"]},"authorids":{"value":["~Mandana_Vaziri1","~Louis_Mandel1","~Martin_Hirzel1","~Anca_Sailer1","~Yuji_Watanabe1","~Hirokuni_Kitahara1"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission27/Authors"]},"keywords":{"value":["Prompt Programming","Agents"]},"TLDR":{"value":"We present PDL, a declarative representation for agentic prompting patterns, which facilitates customization by bringing prompts to the forefront and supporting the composition of LLM calls together with code at a high-level of abstraction."},"track":{"value":"Short Paper (up to 4 pages)"},"abstract":{"value":"Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned patterns that resist customization —making sophisticated agentic programming challenging.

Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/4d61074a42c1bced935bc60bfcd9e44f7fe69943.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in

We introduce InstructFlow, a multi-agent framework that establishes a symbolic, feedback-driven flow of information for code generation in robotic manipulation tasks. InstructFlow employs a InstructFlow Planner to construct and traverse a hierarchical instruction graph that decomposes goals into semantically meaningful subtasks, while a Code Generator generates executable code snippets conditioned on this graph. Crucially, when execution failures occur, a Constraint Generator analyzes feedback and induces symbolic constraints, which are propagated back into the instruction graph to guide targeted code refinement without regenerating from scratch. This dynamic, graph-guided flow enables structured, interpretable, and failure-resilient planning, significantly improving task success rates and robustness across diverse manipulation benchmarks, especially in constraint-sensitive and long-horizon scenarios."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/68f596877ee234802d2853f31eac4e0fe258cdc3.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track."},"Anonymization":{"value":"This submission has been anonymized for double-blind review via the removal of identifying information such as names, affiliations, and identifying URLs."},"Presenter":{"value":"~Haotian_Chi2"},"venue":{"value":"ICML 2025 Workshop PRAL"},"venueid":{"value":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL"},"supplementary_material":{"value":"/attachment/6e0f00b84a05df83de4c6993fc77fe0099d552a5.zip"},"_bibtex":{"value":"@inproceedings{\\nanonymous2025instructflow,\\ntitle={InstructFlow: Adaptive Symbolic Constraint-Guided Code Generation for Long-Horizon Planning},\\nauthor={Anonymous},\\nbooktitle={ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning},\\nyear={2025},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=wr47LsSUjH}\\n}"},"paperhash":{"value":"chi|instructflow_adaptive_symbolic_constraintguided_code_generation_for_longhorizon_planning","readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission23/Authors"]}},"number":23,"invitations":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Post_Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Edit"],"domain":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","tcdate":1748575300076,"cdate":1748575300076,"tmdate":1749884844579,"mdate":1749884844579,"pdate":1749884844537,"version":2,"details":{"writable":true,"replyCount":4,"presentation":[{"name":"title","order":1,"type":"string"},{"name":"keywords","order":4,"type":"string[]"},{"name":"TLDR","order":5,"type":"string","fieldName":"TL;DR"},{"name":"track","order":6,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)","description":null},{"name":"abstract","order":6,"type":"string","input":"textarea","markdown":true},{"name":"pdf","order":7,"type":"file"},{"name":"Format","order":8,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track.","description":null},{"name":"supplementary_material","order":9,"type":"file"},{"name":"De-Anonymization","order":10,"type":"string","input":"radio"},{"name":"Presenter","order":11,"type":"group"},{"name":"authors"},{"name":"authorids"},{"name":"venue","hidden":true},{"name":"venueid","hidden":true},{"name":"_bibtex","type":"string","input":"textarea"},{"name":"Anonymization"}]}},{"id":"pTOQwAQ14h","forum":"pTOQwAQ14h","license":"CC BY 4.0","signatures":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission22/Authors"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission22/Reviewers","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission22/Authors"],"writers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission22/Authors"],"content":{"title":{"value":"Sketch-Plan-Generalize : Learning and Planning with Neuro-Symbolic Programmatic Representations for Inductive Spatial Concepts"},"authors":{"value":["Namasivayam Kalithasan","Sachit Sachdeva","Himanshu Gaurav Singh","Vishal Bindal","Arnav Tuli","Gurarmaan Singh Panjeta","Harsh Himanshu Vora","Divyanshu Agarwal","Rohan Paul","Parag Singla"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission22/Authors"]},"authorids":{"value":["~Namasivayam_Kalithasan1","~Sachit_Sachdeva1","~Himanshu_Gaurav_Singh1","~Vishal_Bindal2","~Arnav_Tuli1","~Gurarmaan_Singh_Panjeta1","cs1210548@cse.iitd.ac.in","~Divyanshu_Agarwal1","~Rohan_Paul1","~Parag_Singla1"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission22/Authors"]},"keywords":{"value":["Concept Learning","Neuro-Symbolic Planning","Continual Learning","Learning from Demonstrations"]},"track":{"value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)"},"abstract":{"value":"Effective human-robot collaboration requires the ability to learn personalized concepts from a limited number of demonstrations, while exhibiting inductive generalization, hierarchical composition, and adaptability to novel constraints. Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (vision) language models as well as purely neural models show poor generalization to _a-priori_ unseen complex concepts.  Neuro-symbolic methods offer a promising alternative by searching in program space, but face challenges in large program spaces due to the inability to effectively guide the search using demonstrations. Our key insight is to factor inductive concept learning as: (i) _Sketch:_ detecting and inferring a coarse signature of a new concept (ii) _Plan:_ performing an MCTS search over grounded action sequences guided by human demonstrations (iii) _Generalize:_ abstracting out  grounded plans as inductive programs. Our pipeline facilitates generalization and modular re-use, enabling continual concept learning.  Our approach combines the benefits of code generation ability of large language models (LLMs) along with grounded neural representations, resulting in neuro-symbolic programs that show stronger inductive generalization on the task of constructing complex structures vis-'a-vis LLM-only and purely neural approaches.

This paper focuses on extracting these knowledge-based insights from demonstrations provided by experts, where we represent the knowledge as a set of logical rules. Our learning framework is built upon the classic  Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). We assume that experts, like clinicians, are rational, and the treatments they choose are the best choices based on their logical understanding of the situation. Our algorithm can automatically extract these logical rules from their demonstrations. We introduce a neural logic tree generator, which is trained to generate logical statements step by step, starting from the goal and working backward. This mirrors the way humans engage in backward reasoning. Similarly, we interpret policy planning as a forward reasoning process, where the optimal policy is determined by finding the best path forward based on the provided rules. The neural logic tree generator and the policy are learned using the IRL until convergence. This process ultimately leads to the discovery of the most effective strategic rules. As a bonus, our algorithm also allows us to recover the reward function. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method excels at discovering meaningful logical rules, particularly in the context of healthcare."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/009cc3a9debbb4252239a4b35beb83cc2b9c2f4b.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track."},"Anonymization":{"value":"This submission has been anonymized for double-blind review via the removal of identifying information such as names, affiliations, and identifying URLs."},"Presenter":{"value":"~Chengzhi_Cao1"},"venue":{"value":"ICML 2025 Workshop PRAL"},"venueid":{"value":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL"},"_bibtex":{"value":"@inproceedings{\\nanonymous2025discovering,\\ntitle={Discovering Logic-Informed Intrinsic Rewards to Explain Human Policies},\\nauthor={Anonymous},\\nbooktitle={ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning},\\nyear={2025},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=mXDB3wuXhN}\\n}"},"paperhash":{"value":"cao|discovering_logicinformed_intrinsic_rewards_to_explain_human_policies","readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission21/Authors"]}},"number":21,"invitations":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Post_Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Edit"],"domain":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","tcdate":1748526227254,"cdate":1748526227254,"tmdate":1749884844385,"mdate":1749884844385,"pdate":1749884844335,"version":2,"details":{"writable":true,"replyCount":4,"presentation":[{"name":"title","order":1,"type":"string"},{"name":"keywords","order":4,"type":"string[]"},{"name":"TLDR","order":5,"type":"string","fieldName":"TL;DR"},{"name":"track","order":6,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)","description":null},{"name":"abstract","order":6,"type":"string","input":"textarea","markdown":true},{"name":"pdf","order":7,"type":"file"},{"name":"Format","order":8,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track.","description":null},{"name":"supplementary_material","order":9,"type":"file"},{"name":"De-Anonymization","order":10,"type":"string","input":"radio"},{"name":"Presenter","order":11,"type":"group"},{"name":"authors"},{"name":"authorids"},{"name":"venue","hidden":true},{"name":"venueid","hidden":true},{"name":"_bibtex","type":"string","input":"textarea"},{"name":"Anonymization"}]}},{"id":"Va937YZ9it","forum":"Va937YZ9it","license":"CC BY 4.0","signatures":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission20/Authors"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission20/Reviewers","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission20/Authors"],"writers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission20/Authors"],"content":{"title":{"value":"Searching Latent Program Spaces"},"authors":{"value":["Matthew Macfarlane","Clément Bonnet"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission20/Authors"]},"authorids":{"value":["~Matthew_Macfarlane1","~Clément_Bonnet1"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission20/Authors"]},"keywords":{"value":["Test-Time Compute","Latent Program Search","Deep Learning","Meta-Learning"]},"TLDR":{"value":"We introduce the Latent Program Network (LPN), a new neural architecture that builds test-time search directly inside its inference, by learning and searching through a latent space of implicit programs before generating outputs."},"track":{"value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)"},"abstract":{"value":"General intelligence requires systems that acquire new skills efficiently and generalize beyond their training distributions. Although program synthesis approaches have strong generalization power, they face scaling issues due to large combinatorial spaces that quickly make them impractical and require human-generated DSLs or pre-trained priors to narrow this search space. On the other hand, deep learning methods have had high successes, but they lack structured test-time adaptation and rely on heavy stochastic sampling or expensive gradient updates for fine-tuning. In this work, we propose the Latent Program Network (LPN), a new architecture that builds in test-time search directly into neural models. LPN learns a latent space of implicit programs---neurally mapping inputs to outputs---through which it can search using gradients at test time. LPN combines the adaptability of symbolic approaches and the scalability of neural methods. It searches through a compact latent space at test time and bypasses the need for pre-defined domain-specific languages. On a range of programming-by-examples tasks, LPN either outperforms or matches performance compared to in-context learning and test-time training methods. Tested on the ARC-AGI benchmark, we demonstrate that LPN can both learn a compact program space and search through it at test time to adapt to novel tasks. LPN doubles its performance on out-of-distribution tasks when test-time search is switched on."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/2f2abc35483f42c316d90a6f44e407d60c26dc99.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track."},"supplementary_material":{"value":"/attachment/56f5e2f36e9ec33710a15fc59882f97bf5dd41f0.zip"},"Anonymization":{"value":"This submission has been anonymized for double-blind review via the removal of identifying information such as names, affiliations, and identifying URLs."},"Presenter":{"value":"~Matthew_Macfarlane1"},"venue":{"value":"ICML 2025 Workshop PRAL"},"venueid":{"value":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL"},"_bibtex":{"value":"@inproceedings{\\nanonymous2025searching,\\ntitle={Searching Latent Program Spaces},\\nauthor={Anonymous},\\nbooktitle={ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning},\\nyear={2025},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Va937YZ9it}\\n}"},"paperhash":{"value":"macfarlane|searching_latent_program_spaces","readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission20/Authors"]}},"number":20,"invitations":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Post_Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Edit"],"domain":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","tcdate":1748477335501,"cdate":1748477335501,"tmdate":1749884844379,"mdate":1749884844379,"pdate":1749884844333,"version":2,"details":{"writable":true,"replyCount":3,"presentation":[{"name":"title","order":1,"type":"string"},{"name":"keywords","order":4,"type":"string[]"},{"name":"TLDR","order":5,"type":"string","fieldName":"TL;DR"},{"name":"track","order":6,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)","description":null},{"name":"abstract","order":6,"type":"string","input":"textarea","markdown":true},{"name":"pdf","order":7,"type":"file"},{"name":"Format","order":8,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track.","description":null},{"name":"supplementary_material","order":9,"type":"file"},{"name":"De-Anonymization","order":10,"type":"string","input":"radio"},{"name":"Presenter","order":11,"type":"group"},{"name":"authors"},{"name":"authorids"},{"name":"venue","hidden":true},{"name":"venueid","hidden":true},{"name":"_bibtex","type":"string","input":"textarea"},{"name":"Anonymization"}]}},{"id":"5zwkRf8Etp","forum":"5zwkRf8Etp","license":"CC BY 4.0","signatures":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission19/Authors"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission19/Reviewers","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission19/Authors"],"writers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission19/Authors"],"content":{"title":{"value":"Lifelong Experience Abstraction and Planning"},"authors":{"value":["Peiqi Liu","Jiayuan Mao","Leslie Pack Kaelbling","Joshua B.

LEAP addresses the challenge of representing flexible knowledge about tasks and environments --- ranging from constraints and subgoal sequences to action plans and high-level goals --- in a unified framework. At its core, LEAP builds on the Crow Definition Language (CDL), a behavior rule language that integrates imperative programming with declarative planning by allowing agents to express both executable subroutines and subgoal hierarchies. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), LEAP translates diverse human instructions into CDL programs, generates planning-compatible code, and abstracts reusable behavior rules from successful executions to support future generalization. LEAP maintains a library of such CDL programs, enabling the agent to accumulate and refine its behavioral repertoire over time. We evaluate LEAP on the VirtualHome benchmark, demonstrating its ability to represent a wide variety of human instructions and its capacity to continually improve task performance through experience and interaction."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/7efaff07f15490fb85cee18fe9fa632becf331e3.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track."},"Anonymization":{"value":"This submission has been anonymized for double-blind review via the removal of identifying information such as names, affiliations, and identifying URLs."},"Presenter":{"value":"~Peiqi_Liu2"},"venue":{"value":"ICML 2025 Workshop PRAL"},"venueid":{"value":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL"},"_bibtex":{"value":"@inproceedings{\\nanonymous2025lifelong,\\ntitle={Lifelong Experience Abstraction and Planning},\\nauthor={Anonymous},\\nbooktitle={ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning},\\nyear={2025},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=5zwkRf8Etp}\\n}"},"paperhash":{"value":"liu|lifelong_experience_abstraction_and_planning","readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission19/Authors"]}},"number":19,"invitations":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Post_Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Edit"],"domain":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","tcdate":1748438035999,"cdate":1748438035999,"tmdate":1749884844271,"mdate":1749884844271,"pdate":1749884844242,"version":2,"details":{"writable":true,"replyCount":4,"presentation":[{"name":"title","order":1,"type":"string"},{"name":"keywords","order":4,"type":"string[]"},{"name":"TLDR","order":5,"type":"string","fieldName":"TL;DR"},{"name":"track","order":6,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)","description":null},{"name":"abstract","order":6,"type":"string","input":"textarea","markdown":true},{"name":"pdf","order":7,"type":"file"},{"name":"Format","order":8,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track.","description":null},{"name":"supplementary_material","order":9,"type":"file"},{"name":"De-Anonymization","order":10,"type":"string","input":"radio"},{"name":"Presenter","order":11,"type":"group"},{"name":"authors"},{"name":"authorids"},{"name":"venue","hidden":true},{"name":"venueid","hidden":true},{"name":"_bibtex","type":"string","input":"textarea"},{"name":"Anonymization"}]}},{"id":"RTI8LsGjSi","forum":"RTI8LsGjSi","license":"CC BY 4.0","signatures":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission18/Authors"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission18/Reviewers","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission18/Authors"],"writers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission18/Authors"],"content":{"title":{"value":"Afterburner: Reinforcement Learning Facilitates Self-Improving Code Efficiency Optimization"},"authors":{"value":["Mingzhe Du","Anh Tuan Luu","Yue Liu","Yuhao QING","Dong HUANG","Xinyi He","Qian Liu","Zejun MA","See-Kiong Ng"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission18/Authors"]},"authorids":{"value":["~Mingzhe_Du1","~Anh_Tuan_Luu2","~Yue_Liu10","~Yuhao_QING1","~Dong_HUANG4","~Xinyi_He2","~Qian_Liu2","~Zejun_MA1","~See-Kiong_Ng1"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission18/Authors"]},"keywords":{"value":["Code Generation"]},"TLDR":{"value":"This paper introduces an iterative optimization framework that leverages real-time execution feedback to improve code efficiency."},"track":{"value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)"},"abstract":{"value":"Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world deployment.

This paper proposes Weak-for-Strong Harnessing (W4S), a novel framework that customizes smaller, cost-efficient language models to design and optimize workflows for harnessing stronger models. W4S formulates workflow design as a multi-turn markov decision process and introduces reinforcement learning for agentic workflow optimization (RLAO) to train a weak meta-agent. Through iterative interaction with the environment, the meta-agent learns to design increasingly effective workflows without manual intervention. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of W4S that our 7B meta-agent, trained with just one GPU hour, outperforms the strongest baseline by 2.9% ～ 24.6% across eleven benchmarks, successfully elevating the performance of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o.

Daily sentiment scores are generated using LLaMA 3.3. SAPPO integrates these signals into the PPO advantage function via a sentiment-weighted term, enabling allocation strategies that respond to both price movements and market sentiment. Experiments on a three-asset portfolio demonstrate that SAPPO increases the Sharpe ratio from 1.55 to 1.90 and reduces drawdowns relative to PPO. The optimal configuration uses a sentiment influence parameter $\\\\lambda = 0.1$, as validated through ablation studies and statistically significant $t$-tests ($p < 0.001$).

While current methods of RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately desire to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, their sensitivity to benchmarks and the brittle and locally optimal nature of strategies learned by these systems suggest that this is far from a fulfilled promise. To instantiate this, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward successful reasoning strategies. We train models to be capable of proposing several useful abstractions given a problem, followed by RL training that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in a two-agent cooperative RL training paradigm, RL through Abstraction Discovery (RLAD), that jointly trains an abstraction generator and an abstraction-conditioned solution generator. This bi-level setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals pertaining to abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems, analogous to what we would expect from hierarchical RL.

To address this, we introduce ReasonRec, a reasoning-augmented multimodal agent structured around a three-stage explicit reasoning pipeline: Observe, via a pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encoder; Deliberate, by formulating recommendation as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks and explicitly quantifying prediction uncertainty through an evidence-horizon-aware curriculum; and Act, through dynamic delegation of uncertain or challenging queries to lightweight classical recommendation models. Specifically, we propose a reasoning-aware visual instruction tuning strategy that systematically transforms diverse recommendation tasks into unified CoT prompts, enabling the VLM to explicitly articulate intermediate decision steps. Additionally, our evidence-horizon curriculum progressively enhances the reasoning complexity to better handle cold-start and long-tail user scenarios, significantly boosting model generalization. Furthermore, the uncertainty-guided delegation mechanism empowers the agent to assess its own confidence, strategically allocating computational resources to optimize both recommendation accuracy and inference efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on four standard recommendation tasks (sequential recommendation, direct recommendation, CTR prediction, and explanation generation) across five real-world datasets demonstrate that ReasonRec achieves over 30% relative improvement in key ranking metrics (e.g., HR@5, NDCG@5) compared to state-of-the-art multimodal recommenders. Crucially, ReasonRec substantially reduces inference latency by dynamically delegating up to 35% of queries to efficient sub-models without compromising accuracy. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that each proposed reasoning and planning mechanism individually contributes substantially to ReasonRec's overall effectiveness. Collectively, our results illustrate a clear pathway towards interpretable, adaptive, and efficient multimodal recommendation through explicit reasoning and agentic design."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/3b6135c8c5ebe9e4cc1bb66c6fcb2fe1434fe5e0.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track."},"Anonymization":{"value":"This submission has been anonymized for double-blind review via the removal of identifying information such as names, affiliations, and identifying URLs."},"Presenter":{"value":"~Yihua_Zhang1"},"venue":{"value":"ICML 2025 Workshop PRAL"},"venueid":{"value":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL"},"_bibtex":{"value":"@inproceedings{\\nanonymous2025reasonrec,\\ntitle={ReasonRec: A Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal Agent for Unified Recommendation},\\nauthor={Anonymous},\\nbooktitle={ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning},\\nyear={2025},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=fCcN2pJ1Vx}\\n}"},"paperhash":{"value":"zhang|reasonrec_a_reasoningaugmented_multimodal_agent_for_unified_recommendation","readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission5/Authors"]}},"number":5,"invitations":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Post_Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Edit"],"domain":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","tcdate":1747891051711,"cdate":1747891051711,"tmdate":1749884843338,"mdate":1749884843338,"pdate":1749884843193,"version":2,"details":{"writable":true,"replyCount":4,"presentation":[{"name":"title","order":1,"type":"string"},{"name":"keywords","order":4,"type":"string[]"},{"name":"TLDR","order":5,"type":"string","fieldName":"TL;DR"},{"name":"track","order":6,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)","description":null},{"name":"abstract","order":6,"type":"string","input":"textarea","markdown":true},{"name":"pdf","order":7,"type":"file"},{"name":"Format","order":8,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track.","description":null},{"name":"supplementary_material","order":9,"type":"file"},{"name":"De-Anonymization","order":10,"type":"string","input":"radio"},{"name":"Presenter","order":11,"type":"group"},{"name":"authors"},{"name":"authorids"},{"name":"venue","hidden":true},{"name":"venueid","hidden":true},{"name":"_bibtex","type":"string","input":"textarea"},{"name":"Anonymization"}]}},{"id":"cnKYqIgNy5","forum":"cnKYqIgNy5","license":"CC BY 4.0","signatures":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission4/Authors"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission4/Reviewers","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission4/Authors"],"writers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission4/Authors"],"content":{"title":{"value":"Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design"},"authors":{"value":["Batu El","Mert Yuksekgonul","James Zou"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission4/Authors"]},"authorids":{"value":["~Batu_El1","~Mert_Yuksekgonul1","~James_Zou1"],"readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission4/Authors"]},"keywords":{"value":["LLM/AI agents","Meta Learning"]},"TLDR":{"value":"We identify key challenges in meta-agent-driven agent design: (1) naïve reuse of discovered agents hinders meta-learning, (2) evolutionary methods improve performance but reduce diversity, and (3) design costs are often not justified."},"track":{"value":"Short Paper (up to 4 pages)"},"abstract":{"value":"Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures.

A key challenge in improving parallel program performance is efficiently mapping tasks to processors and data to memory, a process dictated by intricate, low-level system code known as mappers. Developing high-performance mappers demands days of manual tuning, posing a significant barrier for domain scientists without systems expertise. We introduce a framework that automates mapper development with generative optimization, leveraging richer feedback beyond scalar performance metrics. Our approach features the Agent-System Interface, which includes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to abstract away low-level complexity of system code and define a structured search space, as well as AutoGuide, a mechanism that interprets raw execution output into actionable feedback. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods such as OpenTuner, which rely solely on scalar feedback, our method finds superior mappers in far fewer iterations. With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving $3.8\\\\times$ faster performance. Our approach finds mappers that surpass expert-written mappers by up to $1.34\\\\times$ speedup across nine benchmarks while reducing tuning time from days to minutes."},"pdf":{"value":"/pdf/c8ca5b4c136f37f681a76a423df62bf3238e055c.pdf"},"Format":{"value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track."},"Anonymization":{"value":"This submission has been anonymized for double-blind review via the removal of identifying information such as names, affiliations, and identifying URLs."},"Presenter":{"value":"~Anjiang_Wei1"},"venue":{"value":"ICML 2025 Workshop PRAL"},"venueid":{"value":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL"},"_bibtex":{"value":"@inproceedings{\\nanonymous2025improving,\\ntitle={Improving Parallel Program Performance with {LLM} Optimizers via Agent-System Interfaces},\\nauthor={Anonymous},\\nbooktitle={ICML 2025 Workshop on Programmatic Representations for Agent Learning},\\nyear={2025},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=DFplmbCyR4}\\n}"},"paperhash":{"value":"wei|improving_parallel_program_performance_with_llm_optimizers_via_agentsystem_interfaces","readers":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/Submission3/Authors"]}},"number":3,"invitations":["ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Post_Submission","ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL/-/Edit"],"domain":"ICML.cc/2025/Workshop/PRAL","tcdate":1747776697807,"cdate":1747776697807,"tmdate":1749884843325,"mdate":1749884843325,"pdate":1749884843182,"version":2,"details":{"writable":true,"replyCount":3,"presentation":[{"name":"title","order":1,"type":"string"},{"name":"keywords","order":4,"type":"string[]"},{"name":"TLDR","order":5,"type":"string","fieldName":"TL;DR"},{"name":"track","order":6,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"Long Paper (up to 9 pages)","description":null},{"name":"abstract","order":6,"type":"string","input":"textarea","markdown":true},{"name":"pdf","order":7,"type":"file"},{"name":"Format","order":8,"type":"string","input":"radio","value":"The paper is in either ICML or NeurIPS format and the main paper does not exceed the page limit for our selected track.","description":null},{"name":"supplementary_material","order":9,"type":"file"},{"name":"De-Anonymization","order":10,"type":"string","input":"radio"},{"name":"Presenter","order":11,"type":"group"},{"name":"authors"},{"name":"authorids"},{"name":"venue","hidden":true},{"name":"venueid","hidden":true},{"name":"_bibtex","type":"string","input":"textarea"},{"name":"Anonymization"}]}}]`),ka={notes:ya};var Aa=_('<div class="rounded-xl border border-gray-200 p-6 transition hover:border-blue-500/10 hover:shadow-blue-500/10"><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800"><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hover:underline"> </a></h3> <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600"> </p></div>'),Pa=_('<div class="space-y-6"></div>');function Ca(e,a){ge(a,!1);const t=ka.notes;ce();var r=Pa();ta(r,5,()=>t,ea,(n,i)=>{var s=Aa(),h=y(s),u=y(h),k=y(u,!0);L(u),L(h);var o=p(h,2),P=y(o,!0);L(o),L(s),Z(l=>{K(u,"href",`https://openreview.net/forum?id=${U(i).forum}`),V(k,U(i).content.title.value),V(P,l)},[()=>U(i).content.authors.value.join(", ")],de),R(n,s)}),L(r),R(e,r),fe()}var Ra=_('<h1 class="mb-6 text-2xl font-bold" id="schedule">Tentative Schedule</h1> <div class="mb-6 text-sm"><p><strong>Location:</strong> Meeting 301-305</p> <p><strong>Room Capacity:</strong> 710</p></div> <div><table class="w-full border-collapse border border-gray-300 text-sm"><thead><tr class="bg-gray-100"><th class="border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2 text-left whitespace-nowrap">Time</th><th class="w-full border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2 text-left">Event</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd:bg-white even:bg-gray-50"><td class="border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2 whitespace-nowrap">8:20 -
